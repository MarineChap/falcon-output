    /** Defines the functionality of the processor.

         The process method is called every time a new data buffer is available.

         Processors can either use this method to add new data, manipulate existing
         data, or send data to an external target (such as a display or other hardware).

         Continuous signals arrive in the "buffer" variable, event data (such as TTLs
         and spikes) is contained in the "events" variable, and "nSamples" holds the
         number of continous samples in the current buffer (which may differ from the
         size of the buffer).
